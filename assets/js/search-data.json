            "content": "Strings are used in Python to record text information, such as names. Strings in Python are actually a sequence, which basically means Python keeps track of every element in the string as a sequence. For example, Python understands the string &quot;hello&#39; to be a sequence of letters in a specific order. This means we will be able to use indexing to grab particular letters (like the first letter, or the last letter). . This idea of a sequence is an important one in Python and we will touch upon it later on in the future. . In this lecture we&#39;ll learn about the following: . 1.) Creating Strings 2.) Printing Strings 3.) String Indexing and Slicing 4.) String Properties 5.) String Methods 6.) Print Formatting . Creating a String . To create a string in Python you need to use either single quotes or double quotes. For example: . # Single word &#39;hello&#39; . &#39;hello&#39; . # Entire phrase &#39;This is also a string&#39; . &#39;This is also a string&#39; . # We can also use double quote &quot;String built with double quotes&quot; . &#39;String built with double quotes&#39; . # Be careful with quotes! &#39; I&#39;m using single quotes, but this will create an error&#39; . File &#34;&lt;ipython-input-4-da9a34b3dc31&gt;&#34;, line 2 &#39; I&#39;m using single quotes, but this will create an error&#39; ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . The reason for the error above is because the single quote in I&#39;m stopped the string. You can use combinations of double and single quotes to get the complete statement. . &quot;Now I&#39;m ready to use the single quotes inside a string!&quot; . &#34;Now I&#39;m ready to use the single quotes inside a string!&#34; . Now let&#39;s learn about printing strings! . Printing a String . Using Jupyter notebook with just a string in a cell will automatically output strings, but the correct way to display strings in your output is by using a print function. . # We can simply declare a string &#39;Hello World&#39; . &#39;Hello World&#39; . # Note that we can&#39;t output multiple strings this way &#39;Hello World 1&#39; &#39;Hello World 2&#39; . &#39;Hello World 2&#39; . We can use a print statement to print a string. . print(&#39;Hello World 1&#39;) print(&#39;Hello World 2&#39;) print(&#39;Use n to print a new line&#39;) print(&#39; n&#39;) print(&#39;See what I mean?&#39;) . Hello World 1 Hello World 2 Use to print a new line See what I mean? . String Basics . We can also use a function called len() to check the length of a string! . len(&#39;Hello World&#39;) . 11 . Python&#39;s built-in len() function counts all of the characters in the string, including spaces and punctuation. . String Indexing . We know strings are a sequence, which means Python can use indexes to call parts of the sequence. Let&#39;s learn how this works. . In Python, we use brackets [] after an object to call its index. We should also note that indexing starts at 0 for Python. Let&#39;s create a new object called s and then walk through a few examples of indexing. . # Assign s as a string s = &#39;Hello World&#39; . #Check s . &#39;Hello World&#39; . # Print the object print(s) . Hello World . Let&#39;s start indexing! . # Show first element (in this case a letter) s[0] . &#39;H&#39; . s[1] . &#39;e&#39; . s[2] . &#39;l&#39; . We can use a : to perform slicing which grabs everything up to a designated point. For example: . # Grab everything past the first term all the way to the length of s which is len(s) s[1:] . &#39;ello World&#39; . # Note that there is no change to the original s s . &#39;Hello World&#39; . # Grab everything UP TO the 3rd index s[:3] . &#39;Hel&#39; . Note the above slicing. Here we&#39;re telling Python to grab everything from 0 up to 3. It doesn&#39;t include the 3rd index. You&#39;ll notice this a lot in Python, where statements and are usually in the context of &quot;up to, but not including&quot;. . #Everything s[:] . &#39;Hello World&#39; . We can also use negative indexing to go backwards. . # Last letter (one index behind 0 so it loops back around) s[-1] . &#39;d&#39; . # Grab everything but the last letter s[:-1] . &#39;Hello Worl&#39; . We can also use index and slice notation to grab elements of a sequence by a specified step size (the default is 1). For instance we can use two colons in a row and then a number specifying the frequency to grab elements. For example: . # Grab everything, but go in steps size of 1 s[::1] . &#39;Hello World&#39; . # Grab everything, but go in step sizes of 2 s[::2] . &#39;HloWrd&#39; . # We can use this to print a string backwards s[::-1] . &#39;dlroW olleH&#39; . String Properties . It&#39;s important to note that strings have an important property known as immutability. This means that once a string is created, the elements within it can not be changed or replaced. For example: . s . &#39;Hello World&#39; . # Let&#39;s try to change the first letter to &#39;x&#39; s[0] = &#39;x&#39; . TypeError Traceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-11-976942677f11&gt; in &lt;module&gt; 1 # Let&#39;s try to change the first letter to &#39;x&#39; -&gt; 2 s[0] = &#39;x&#39; TypeError: &#39;str&#39; object does not support item assignment . Notice how the error tells us directly what we can&#39;t do, change the item assignment! . Something we can do is concatenate strings! . s . &#39;Hello World&#39; . # Concatenate strings! s + &#39; concatenate me!&#39; . &#39;Hello World concatenate me!&#39; . # We can reassign s completely though! s = s + &#39; concatenate me!&#39; . print(s) . Hello World concatenate me! . s . &#39;Hello World concatenate me!&#39; . We can use the multiplication symbol to create repetition! . letter = &#39;z&#39; . letter*10 . &#39;zzzzzzzzzz&#39; . Basic Built-in String methods . Objects in Python usually have built-in methods. These methods are functions inside the object (we will learn about these in much more depth later) that can perform actions or commands on the object itself. . We call methods with a period and then the method name. Methods are in the form: . object.method(parameters) . Where parameters are extra arguments we can pass into the method. Don&#39;t worry if the details don&#39;t make 100% sense right now. Later on we will be creating our own objects and functions! . Here are some examples of built-in methods in strings: . s . &#39;Hello World concatenate me!&#39; . # Upper Case a string s.upper() . &#39;HELLO WORLD CONCATENATE ME!&#39; . # Lower case s.lower() . &#39;hello world concatenate me!&#39; . # Split a string by blank space (this is the default) s.split() . [&#39;Hello&#39;, &#39;World&#39;, &#39;concatenate&#39;, &#39;me!&#39;] . # Split by a specific element (doesn&#39;t include the element that was split on) s.split(&#39;W&#39;) . [&#39;Hello &#39;, &#39;orld concatenate me!&#39;] . There are many more methods than the ones covered here. Visit the Advanced String section to find out more! . Print Formatting . We can use the .format() method to add formatted objects to printed string statements. . The easiest way to show this is through an example: . &#39;Insert another string with curly brackets: {}&#39;.format(&#39;The inserted string&#39;) . &#39;Insert another string with curly brackets: The inserted string&#39; . We will revisit this string formatting topic in later sections when we are building our projects! . Next up: Lists! .",

            "content": "Rules for variable names . names can not start with a number | names can not contain spaces, use _ intead | names can not contain any of these symbols: . :&#39;&quot;,&lt;&gt;/?| !@#%^&amp;*~-+ . | it&#39;s considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase with underscores . | avoid using Python built-in keywords like list and str | avoid using the single characters l (lowercase letter el), O (uppercase letter oh) and I (uppercase letter eye) as they can be confused with 1 and 0 | . Dynamic Typing . Python uses dynamic typing, meaning you can reassign variables to different data types. This makes Python very flexible in assigning data types; it differs from other languages that are statically typed. . my_dogs = 2 . my_dogs . 2 . my_dogs = [&#39;Sammy&#39;, &#39;Frankie&#39;] . my_dogs . [&#39;Sammy&#39;, &#39;Frankie&#39;] . Pros and Cons of Dynamic Typing . Pros of Dynamic Typing . very easy to work with | faster development time | . Cons of Dynamic Typing . may result in unexpected bugs! | you need to be aware of type() | . Assigning Variables . Variable assignment follows name = object, where a single equals sign = is an assignment operator . p = 10 . p . 10 . l = 5 . l . 5 . Here we assigned the integer object 5 to the variable name a.Let&#39;s assign a to something else: . a = 10 . a . 10 . You can now use a in place of the number 10: . a + a . 20 . Reassigning Variables . Python lets you reassign variables with a reference to the same object. . a = a + 10 . a . 20 . There&#39;s actually a shortcut for this. Python lets you add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers with reassignment using +=, -=, *=, and /=. . a += 10 . a . 30 . a *= 2 . a . 60 . Determining variable type with type() . You can check what type of object is assigned to a variable using Python&#39;s built-in type() function. Common data types include: . int (for integer) | float | str (for string) | list | tuple | dict (for dictionary) | set | bool (for Boolean True/False) | . type(a) . int . a = (1,2) . type(a) . tuple . Simple Exercise . This shows how variables make calculations more readable and easier to follow. . my_income = 100 tax_rate = 0.1 my_taxes = my_income * tax_rate . my_taxes . 10.0 . Great! You should now understand the basics of variable assignment and reassignment in Python.Up next, we&#39;ll learn about strings! .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
